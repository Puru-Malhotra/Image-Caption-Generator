# Image-Caption-Generator
Automatic Image Caption Generator using NLP and Deep Learning techniques


The Flickr 8k Dataset was used to train the model.
It preprocesses the images and automatically generates a suitable caption for it.

The preprocessing over the captions in the dataset and done using NLP techniques to sort and filter the text. 

An pretrained Xception model is used for feature extraction from image and then these features are paired up with our dataset to generate a caption in text format.
